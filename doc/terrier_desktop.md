Introducing the Desktop Terrier example search application:
=============================================

Desktop Terrier is an example application we have provided with Terrier for two purposes:

-   To provide a Desktop Search application that will allow users to quickly test out features of Terrier such as for example the Terrier query language.

-   To give developers an example of using Terrier in an interactive setting.

Importantly, Desktop Terrier is only a sample application to help users become used to the functionality that Terrier provides. We do not recommend Desktop Terrier to perform large or complex indexing jobs. Instead, once you are comfortable with the Terrier functionality, indexing and batch retrieval should be performed using the command line. You have been warned.

Where to obtain Desktop Terrier

Since version 4.2, the Terrier Desktop search application is available [separately from Github](https://github.com/terrier-org/terrier-desktop).
