[![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/terrier-org/terrier-core.svg?branch=5.x)](https://travis-ci.org/terrier-org/terrier-core)

[Terrier](http://terrier.org) is a highly flexible, efficient, and effective open source search engine, readily deployable on large-scale collections of documents. Terrier implements state-of-the-art indexing and retrieval functionalities, and provides an ideal platform for the rapid development and evaluation of large-scale retrieval applications.

Terrier is open source, and is a comprehensive, flexible and transparent platform for research and experimentation in text retrieval. [Research can easily be carried out](http://terrier.org/docs/current/bibliography.html) on standard [TREC](http://trec.nist.gov/) and [CLEF](http://www.clef-initiative.eu/) test collections.

Terrier is written in Java, and is developed at the School of Computing Science, [University of Glasgow](http://www.gla.ac.uk/).

The latest version of Terrier can be found at https://github.com/terrier-org/terrier-core/
